1. Create a webpage with a 16 x 16 grid of square divs.  Create them using javascript, not by hand.  
2. Set up a "hover" effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.
3. Add a button on the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid.  Once entered, the existing grid should be removed and the new grid should be generated in the same total space as before.

### Extra Credit
1. Rather than squares being the same color throughout the grid, randomize the squares' RGB values with each interaction
2. Additionally, implemetn a progressive darkening effect where each interaction darkens the square by 10%.  The objective is a completely black square after only ten interactions.
